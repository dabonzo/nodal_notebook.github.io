If so, this article is tailor-made for you.</p>"},{"location":"technical_advice/auto-adjusting-screen-resolutions-kvm-qemu-udev-spice/#the-problem","title":"The Problem","text":"<p>Using virtual machines, particularly with QEMU/KVM and <code>virt-manager</code>, I consistently encountered a snag: the screen resolution wouldn't automatically adjust to match the window size. This became particularly evident after upgrading a pre-built QEMU Virtual Machine. Everything worked perfectly at first, but the display resize feature stopped functioning later on, a problem I similarly noted with the netinstaller ISO.</p> <p>Digging into this, I found the issue to be more prevalent with the XFCE desktop environment. Curiously, KDE and GNOME appeared unaffected, hinting at an underlying concern with XFCE. Considering the dated software on the pre-built VM, it's likely that updates or changes implemented between its initial release and subsequent upgrades introduced this issue.</p> <p>Importantly, while my experience was with Kali Linux, this challenge is not exclusive to it; it's evident across multiple distributions. The silver lining? Utilizing <code>udev</code> rules can offer a comprehensive remedy for all Linux guest OSes that integrate <code>udev</code>.</p>"},{"location":"technical_advice/auto-adjusting-screen-resolutions-kvm-qemu-udev-spice/#the-solution","title":"The Solution","text":"<p>Without further ado, here is the rule and the script that tackles the issue:</p> <p>File: <code>/etc/udev/rules.d/50-resize.rules</code></p> <pre><code>ACTION==\"change\", KERNEL==\"card0\", SUBSYSTEM==\"drm\", RUN+=\"/usr/local/bin/resize\"\n</code></pre> Explaining the <code>udev</code> rule <p>This rule listens for any changes (<code>ACTION==\"change\"</code>) on the primary graphics card (<code>KERNEL==\"card0\"</code>) under the <code>drm</code> (Direct Rendering Manager) subsystem. The <code>drm</code> subsystem is responsible for interfacing with GPUs in Linux and handles tasks like rendering graphics and adjusting screen resolutions.</p> <p>Whenever a change is detected, it triggers (<code>RUN+</code>) our script (<code>/usr/local/bin/resize</code>), which will then adjust the screen resolution of the virtual machine.</p> <p>File: <code>/usr/local/bin/resize</code></p> <pre><code>#!/bin/bash\n\ndeclare -A unique_users display_to_user_mapping\n\n# Identify unique users (excluding root)\nfor current_user in $(users); do\n[[ $current_user = root ]] &amp;&amp; continue\nunique_users[$current_user]=1\ndone\n\n# Map displays to users\nfor user in \"${!unique_users[@]}\"; do\nfor display_info in $(ps e -u \"$user\" | grep -o 'DISPLAY=:[0-9]*'); do\ndisplay_number=\"${display_info#*=}\"\ndisplay_to_user_mapping[$display_number]=$user\ndone\ndone\n\n# Adjust resolution for each user's display\nfor display in \"${!display_to_user_mapping[@]}\"; do\nassociated_user=\"${display_to_user_mapping[$display]}\"\nuser_display=\"$display\"\noutput_device=$(sudo -u \"$associated_user\" DISPLAY=\"$user_display\" xrandr | awk '/ connected/{print $1; exit;}')\nsudo -u \"$associated_user\" DISPLAY=\"$user_display\" xrandr --output \"$output_device\" --auto\ndone\n</code></pre> <p>Dive deeper if you're curious about how the code functions:</p> How the script works <p>Explanation:</p> <ul> <li> <p>User Identification: The script begins by identifying all the users currently logged in, making a list of unique users. Notably, the <code>root</code> user is excluded. This is because in Linux environments, the <code>root</code> user typically does not run graphical sessions; it's generally considered insecure to do so. Hence, there's no screen to resize for the <code>root</code> user.</p> </li> <li> <p>Display Mapping: Once the users are identified, the script maps the display environment variable (<code>DISPLAY</code>) to each user. This is crucial because in Linux, graphical sessions are linked with a <code>DISPLAY</code> value, which essentially indicates which screen or monitor the graphical output is being sent to.</p> </li> <li> <p>Resolution Adjustment: With the user-to-display map in hand, the script then cycles through each display, determines its output device (like HDMI-1 or eDP-1) using the <code>xrandr</code> tool, and finally resizes the display to fit automatically using the <code>--auto</code> flag.</p> </li> </ul> <p>In a Nutshell: The script automates what can be a manual and cumbersome process: ensuring your virtual machine's display dynamically adjusts to your window size, providing an uninterrupted user experience. By excluding <code>root</code>, it also ensures the security principle of minimizing potential attack surfaces is maintained. By pairing the above script with the simple udev rule, we can automatically adjust the display resolution whenever there's a change in the VM window size.

It dynamically manages device nodes in the /dev directory and offers userspace events whenever the status of hardware (like adding/removing devices) changes.</p> More about <code>udev</code> <p><code>udev</code> is widely used in the Linux ecosystem. It has become the de facto standard for device detection and management in modern Linux distributions. Here's why it's prevalent:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Unified Device Management: Before <code>udev</code>, device node handling in the <code>/dev</code> directory was static. As Linux systems became more dynamic, especially with the proliferation of USB devices and other hot-pluggable hardware, a more flexible system was required. <code>udev</code> fills this need by providing dynamic device node creation and management.</p> </li> <li> <p>Part of <code>systemd</code>: In many modern Linux distributions, <code>udev</code> functionality has been merged into <code>systemd</code> as <code>systemd-udevd</code>. <code>systemd</code> itself is a widely adopted init system and service manager for Linux. This integration further solidified <code>udev</code>'s position in the Linux ecosystem.</p> </li> <li> <p>Configurability: <code>udev</code> allows administrators and developers to write rules specific to their needs. This level of customizability is beneficial for various applications, ranging from desktops to servers to embedded systems.</p> </li> <li> <p>Consistent Device Naming: <code>udev</code> provides persistent device naming, ensuring that devices get consistent names across reboots. This feature is essential for administrators and users, ensuring, for example, that storage devices always get mounted at the expected locations.</p> </li> <li> <p>Hotplug Support: Modern computers frequently have devices added or removed while the system is running (think USB devices, SD cards, etc.). <code>udev</code> supports such hotplug scenarios, ensuring the system reacts appropriately when devices are plugged or unplugged.</p> </li> <li> <p>Compatibility: While <code>udev</code> provides advanced features and configurability, it's designed to be backward compatible. This means even systems or setups that depended on the older, static <code>/dev</code> approach can still function under <code>udev</code>.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Given its importance and the functionalities it offers, <code>udev</code> is a critical component in nearly all major Linux distributions today.

The SPICE agent facilitates many enhanced functionalities, including clipboard sharing, automatic screen resizing, and more.</p> <p>Here's how it all comes together:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Guest Display Resizing: When you resize the QEMU/KVM guest window on the host, the SPICE client (like <code>virt-viewer</code> or <code>spicy</code>) sends a message to the SPICE server component running with QEMU, indicating the new screen dimensions.</p> </li> <li> <p>SPICE Server to Guest: The SPICE server then communicates this information to the <code>spice-vdagent</code> running inside the guest. This is achieved using a virtual channel.</p> </li> <li> <p>Notification to the System: Once the <code>spice-vdagent</code> in the guest receives the resize information, it triggers a change event in the graphics subsystem.
